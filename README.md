- I like Haskell, Scala, Parallel and Distributed programming, Compilers and anything that's interesting.

Here are some repos that I'm proud of:

- [Lexer Generator In Scala](../../../Lexer-Generator-in-Scala)
- [Tolerant to Partitions Distributed Calculation In c++](../../../Distributed-Calculation-in-cpp)
- [Generic Map-Reduce in c++](../../../Map-Reduce-in-cpp)
- [Emag-like Parallel Order Processing in Java](../../../Parallel-Product-Processing-in-Java)
- [Graphical Interface for Automata in Python](../../../DFA-NFA-Graphic-Interface)
- [LeetCode Solutions in Scala](../../../LeetCode-in-Scala)
